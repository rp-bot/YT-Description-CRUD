# YouTube Channel CRUD

Create-Read-Update-Delete stuff in your youtube channel. Makes things like updating old descriptions, titles and thumbnails very easy.

## Installation

-   ```sh
    pipenv install
    ```
-   make a copy of the `/.secrets.template` directory and rename it `.secrets`
-   Make sure the directory ~~grays~~ out if you are using git
-   Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`

## Setup

-   [(Option 1)](#public-only) If you want only **Read** features. You can use the [API Keys](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) provided by Google which only relays the public facing data. That being said, It is still very powerful.
-   [(Option 2)](#full-crud) If you want all of the **CRUD** features then you might want to consider getting an [OAuth 2.0 Client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849)

#### Public Only

1. Once you have obtained your api key from [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/?hl=vi), Copy the **API Key** and paste it into the `.env` file. Follow [Installation](#installation) if you haven't already followed the steps to create `.env` file.
